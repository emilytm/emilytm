      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will

          <h2>About me - the short version</h2>
          <p>Hi, I’m Emily! I’m a newly-minted front-end developer with 7 years of experience in product management and design. I’ve worked at companies big and small, on new and existing products, in various ecosystems with different business models and disparate development and deployment processes, but the one constant in my career has been that I have felt most engaged with my work when I am solving technical problems or thinking through the logic that underpins product developments. With an introduction to computer science at the Tufts University School of Engineering and lots of experience working alongside and learning from incredibly talented engineers, I decided that the best way for me to gain the skills I needed to become an engineer would be to teach myself by cobbling together the right mix of tools, resources, and classes. I’m still learning everyday but I now have a strong enough foundation to start looking for opportunities as a front-end developer. What I lack in coding experience I make up for in a close familiarity with every part of the actual front-end engineering process, a wealth of knowledge, both technical and tactical, gained from learning from incredible engineers throughout my career, the problem solving skills that going to engineering school can get you, and a huge amount of energy and enthusiasm for making work a place that myself and others are excited to be.</p>
